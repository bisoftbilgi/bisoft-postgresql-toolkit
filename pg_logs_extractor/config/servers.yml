# PostgreSQL nodes (folder name -> metadata)
# server_id is derived from the folder name:
#   /logs/<server_id>/postgresql-*.log
#
# Add as many nodes as you need. Example pattern:
# pg-01: '{"cluster_name":"prod-pg","server_name":"pg-01","server_ip":"10.0.10.11"}'

pg-01: '{"cluster_name":"prod-pg","server_name":"pg-01","server_ip":"10.0.10.11"}'

# Uncomment / duplicate as needed
# pg-02: '{"cluster_name":"prod-pg","server_name":"pg-02","server_ip":"10.0.10.12"}'
# pg-03: '{"cluster_name":"prod-pg","server_name":"pg-03","server_ip":"10.0.10.13"}'
